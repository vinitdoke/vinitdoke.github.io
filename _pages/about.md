I am a final year (5th) student at IIT Bombay pursuing an Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering (M.Tech.)
and Engineering Physics (B.Tech.). I am currently working on my thesis under the guidance of Prof. Udayan Ganguly on developing
FeFET-based neuromorphic hardware for DNN Acceleration.
